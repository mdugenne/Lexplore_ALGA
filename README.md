We are developing an image-based pipeline to monitor phytoplankton populations in Lake Léman using imaging devices (FlowCams, CytoSense).

The objective for the project Interreg/ALGA are:

1. develop a semi-automated pipeline to recognize important phytoplankton populations, responsible for massive outbreaks in the lake or simply important to maintain key ecosystem services (e.g. carbon fixation and burial in lake sediments, fueling the aquatic food chain),based on machine learning algorithms

2. improve libraries of freshwater plankton images

3. support early warning and decision tools regarding potential outbreaks for lake stakeholders

4. understanding the environmental conditions leading to phytoplankton outbreaks
